# dAETingSim

This repository is for The dAETing Sim Experience, a narrative game centered around the AET experience, giving incoming freshmen a fun and engaging introduction to the program while showcasing the majorâ€™s foundations, spaces, and diverse and collaborative student base!

It includes the Ren'Py project and game, as well as the scripts created by Nada Aburayyan.

This game was made by 4 Seniors over the course of a semester as a Senior Design Project submission at UT Austin:

Caroline Wax (Writer & Narrative Lead) 

JT Chambers (Sound Designer & Composer) 

Megan Clarke (Character & Environment Artist) 

Nada Aburayyan (Programmer & Scripter)

Each file is commented and explains what it does.

IMPORTANT TIPS:
- You can utilize the SAVE and LOAD functions, located in the main and pause menus as well as at the bottom of the dialogue box. This will help you go back to important decisions to try out different paths (ex: saving once you reach the point of choosing whihc student to work with).
- You can use the SKIP function, also located at the bottom of the dialogue box, to speed through parts of the story you've experienced before (such as the intro chapter).
